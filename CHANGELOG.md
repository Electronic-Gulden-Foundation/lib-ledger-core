## 2.6.0

> 2019/02/22

- Change the internal representation of `DynamicObject`. The new representation is optimized not
  only memory-wise but also type-safety-wise. The internal interfaces were also redesigned to allow
  for a smoother transition to C++17’s `std::variant` when we see fit.
- Add support for changing password in `Preferences`. This is not exposed directly via the
  interface: instead, you must use the password changing mechanisme of `WalletPool`. See below for
  further details.
- Implement sqlite3 database encryption through SQLCipher (https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher). If the
  `WalletPool::newInstance` is used with native (sqlite3) backend and called with a password (non-empty string),
  the database will be encrypted. To change password, a `changeDatabasePassword` is provided.
  SQLCipher is not available for Windows builds mainly because of build issues (C compiler containing spaces).
- Changed deployement process, now RCs are deployed with format `x.y.z-rc-{COMMIT_HASH}`, this will allow us
  not to always bump the versions when merging PRs and also keeping the binaries deployed to our bucket.
- Update used libraries, to be able to compile under VS2017

## 2.5.0

> 2019/01/22

- Resetting the libcore to its fresh state is now possible via the `WalletPool::freshResetAll`
  function.

## 2.4.0

> 2019/01/22

- Add the possibility to switch off the internal logger of libcore — this rely on the
  `DynamicObject` that now has a new boolean configuration, `"ENABLE_INTERNAL_LOGGING"`. Set it
  to `true` to enable the internal logging (default), otherwise, set to `false` to completely
  disable internal logging (this also will prevent the core library from creating log files).

## 2.3.0

> 2019/01/21

- Change the way the library is compiled and linked by using explicit interface libraries. This
  also fixes a Windows issues related to non-explicitly exported symbols.

### 2.2.1

> 2019/02/07

- Backport a patch to fix encryption password in `WalletPool`. A bug was introduced in previous
  version (not affecting production) that caused a non-empty string to be accepted by a
  `WalletPool`, yield encryption. As that should allow for explicit encryption with empty passwords,
  we forbid that and empty password will result in no encryption.

## 2.2.0

> 2019/01/15

- Add a new mechanism to `DatabaseEngine`. This allows custom database driver, which allow switching
  between database backends easier.'

## 2.1.0

> 2019/01/15

- Implement `Preferences` encryption via LevelDB. Only the values are encrypted. Be careful
  though: this change doesn’t provide a solution when you want to reset or change your password
  (already encrypted values will remain still). A fix for this is foreseen later.

## 2.0.0

> 2019/01/04

- Support of new coin family: Ethereum-like currencies, with an integration of Ethereum as first
  currency of this family.
- Support of ERC20 tokens.
- We do not support other smart contracts which are not ERC20 yet; to be more specific, internal
  transactions are not caught during synchronization of Ethereum accounts.

# 0.9.0

> 2018/05/14

- First beta release of libledger-core for Ledger Vault integration
