# Ledger Core Library

Core library which will be used by Ledger applications.

## Clone project

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LedgerHQ/lib-ledger-core.git
```

> If you had already forked / cloned the repository before issuing that command, it’s okay. You can
> initiate the submodules with the following commands:

```
cd lib-ledger-core
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Dependencies

### Build

This project is based on **_cmake_** as a build system so you should install it before starting (at least version 3.7).

### External dependencies:

* [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/download) is needed to build tests of the library.
* Generation of binding is automated with [Djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni).
* Build on multiple Operating Systems is based on [polly](https://github.com/ruslo/polly) toolchains.

## Build of C++ library

**_cmake_** is building out of source, you should create a build directory (e.g. `lib-ledger-core-build`):

	.                           # Directory where clone command was launched
    ├── lib-ledger-core         # Source files directory
    ├── lib-ledger-core-build   # Build directory

If you respect this folder structure (and naming), after `cd lib-ledger-core-build`, you can build the library by running:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/qt5 ../lib-ledger-core && make
```

> (*macOSX users*) If you struggle to find where Qt5 is located, for example, on `macOSX`, `qt5` can
> be found at:

```
/usr/local/Cellar/qt/<qt_version>/bin
```

### Building for JNI

Building with JNI (Java Native Interface), allows you to use the library with Java based software. In order to enable JNI mode use

```
cmake -DTARGET_JNI=ON
``` 

This will add JNI files to the library compilation and remove tests. You need at least a JDK 7 to build for JNI (OpenJDK or Oracle JDK)

## Documentation

You can generate the Doxygen documentation by running the `doc` target (for instance, `make doc`
with makefiles).

## Binding to node JS

Generate binding (under `build/Release/ledgerapp_nodejs.node`):

```
npm i
```

## Test NodeJs

```
node ledger-core-samples/nodejs/tests/wallet-pool-test.js
```

## Build library on docker

You can build the core library or debug it from a docker image:

1. Build the image `docker build -t ledger-core-env .` (considering that you are currently at the root of the repository)
2. Run the image `docker run -ti --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined ledger-core-env`
3. Notice that stopping a container will wipe it. If you need multiple instance over the same container one way is to start the container as a daemon and then get a shell on it.
    1. Start the container as daemon `docker run --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -d ledger-core-env`
    2. Get the container ID with `docker ps`
    3. Open shells `docker exec -ti :container_id zsh` where :container_id has to be replaced by the container you got from `docker ps`
    
Note: If you feel on fire you could use docker volumes to persist data.
